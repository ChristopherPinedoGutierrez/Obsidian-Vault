#### Reminder
The present perfect is used for several reasons:

1. to talk about past experiences (at an unspecified time)  
2. for an action in the past with a result now
3. to describe things that started in the past and are still happening now
#### Example
1. I have​ been​​ to Scotland. (I don't specify when this happened.)
2. Can you pay for this? I've left​ my money at home. (I can't pay for the coffee now because of a past action.)
3. I've worked in this shop for five years. (I work in the shop now.)

#### Important

In questions about unspecified times in the past, we often use **'ever'.**
In statements, we often use **'never'**.
E.g. Have you **ever** eaten caviar (in your life)?
I've **never** eaten caviar (in my life). It looks weird.

#### Tips and Tricks
We use 'for' and 'since' to say **how long**.

for  + the duration of time 
E.g. She has worked in the shop for three years.
since + a moment in the past
E.g. I've known her since 2016.

#### Tips and Tricks
We use 'yet​' and 'still​' to talk about things that **haven't happened**. Their meanings are similar.

have not ... + yet 
E.g. I haven't decided yet​ (but I will soon decide).
still + have not
E.g. I still​ haven't decided (and time is passing).

#### Important
**Do not use the present perfect in a finished time period.** 

I have been​ to the supermarket this week. **('This week' is not finished). - correct​**
​ I have been to the supermarket yesterday​. **('Yesterday' is finished). - incorrect**


| Present perfect |                                                          |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Positive        | Subject + have/has + past participle​ (p.p.) ​           |
| Negative        | Subject + have not / haven't / has not / hasn't + p.p. ​ |
| Questions       | Have / Has + subject + p.p.​?                            |

#### Example

_(Louise enters the room with lots of bags.)_

She has been to the shopping centre.

_(Dave wears the same clothes every day.)_

He hasn't bought any new clothes for a long time.

_(Anna looks great today.)_

Have they seen your new clothes?

#### Reminder

When we talk about **how long** we use 'for' and 'since' **before the time period**. 

#### Example

I have lived here for six months.

I have lived here since January.

#### Reminder

'Yet'​ and 'still'​ are used in negative sentences. 'Yet' comes **at the end of the sentence**. 'Still' comes **before 'haven't'**.

I haven't seen​ her new outfit yet​.

She still​ hasn't shown​ him her new outfit.

#### Tips and Tricks

It is common for the verb 'have' to be used in its contracted form.

I've, She's, We've
