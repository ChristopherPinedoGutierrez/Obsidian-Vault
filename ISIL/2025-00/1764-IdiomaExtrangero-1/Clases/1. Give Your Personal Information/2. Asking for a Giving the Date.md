2. Today is Saturday the 6th of October, 2020. 

3. I was born in 1998. (nineteen ninety-eight)

**Asking for and Giving the Date**

|Question|Answer|
|---|---|
|What day is it today?|It’s + day of the week.|
|What’s the date today?|It’s + month + ordinal number (+ year).  <br>OR  <br>It's + _the_ + ordinal number + _of_ + month (+ year).|

#### Reminder

**Days and Months**

  

Days of the week and months of the year start with a **capital letter**​ in English: 

  

- **M​**onday, **T​**uesday, **W**​ednesday, **T​**hursday, **F​**riday, **S​**aturday, **S​**unday

- **J​**anuary, **F​**ebruary, **M**​arch, **A​**pril, **M​**ay, **J​**une, **J​**uly, **A​**ugust, **S​**eptember, **O​**ctober, **N**ovember, **D​**ecember  
    

  

**Ordinal Numbers to Say the Date**

In English, we use **ordinal numbers** to talk about dates. 

We make ordinal numbers by adding “th” at the end. 

#### Example

Look at these examples: 

  

07/10/2019  Today is the 7th of October, 2019.  **seventh**

10/09/2009  She was born on the 10th of September, 2009.  **tenth**

25/12  Some people celebrate Christmas on December 25th.  **twenty-fifth** 

We say dates in two ways: 

- **the ​**+ ordinal number + **of ​**+ month  **the ​**seventh **of ​**October 

- month + ordinal number  December twenty-**fifth**

#### Important

**Exceptions**

  

1  first

1 January   We do not say “oneth January”​.​  We say “the first of January​​” or “January first​​”.  

  

2  second

2 February   We do not say “twoeth February”​.​  We say “February second​​” or “the second of February​​”.  

  

3  third

3 March   We do not say “threeth March”. ​  We say “​March third​”​ or “​​the third of March​”​​

  

5  fifth

  

8  eighth

  

9  ninth

  

12  twelfth

  

“y​”   “ie​”  

In the numbers 20 (twenty​), 30 (thirty​), 40 (forty​), etc., the letter “y​” becomes “ie​” in the ordinals: 

20th (twentie​th), 30th (thirtie​th), 40th (fortie​th), etc.  

  

#### Tips and Tricks

**Abbreviations** 

first  1_st_

second  2_nd_

**Saying the Year in English**

  

In English, we often split the year into two parts: 

19​75​  nineteen ​seventy-five​

  

From 2000 to 2009 (2001, 2002, etc.), we usually don’t split the year:

2001​  two thousand (and) one​

  

From 2010 and onwards, we split the year again: 

20​11​  twenty ​eleven ​

or 

2011 ​ two thousand (and) eleven
