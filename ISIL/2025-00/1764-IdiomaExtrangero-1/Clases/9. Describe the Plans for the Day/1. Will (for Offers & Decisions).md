# 1. Meaning - Summary

#### Reminder

You can use will when you make an immediate or spontaneous decision. It can be a quick decision or an offer, or both. 

#### Important

Will is **NOT**​ used to talk about things you decided earlier in the past. (When you talk about decisions you made earlier, or in the past, you use "going to".)

#### Example

Look! My friends are over there ... I will introduce you. (Quick decision and offer)  

What! You forgot your purse? Don't worry. I'll pay. (Immediate decision and offer)

A: When are you going on holiday?

B: Oh .. I don't know. Maybe I'll​ wait​ until September. (Spontaneous decision)

# 2. Form - Summary

#### Reminder

(+) subject + will​ + verb​ (base form)​

#### Example

(Doorbell rings) "I'll​ get​ it". (Immediate decision)

A: "This homework is very difficult."

B: "I'll​ help​ you if you like?" (Offer)

#### Reminder

(-) subject + won't​ + verb​ (base form)​

#### Example

(It's very late at night) "Hmm, I won't​ call​ them now." (Quick decision)

(It's raining heavily) "Oh ... I won't​ wear​ my new shoes now. I'll​ wait ​for a dry day."

#### Important

Offers

'Shall'​ is used ... not 'will'​.

Shall​ + I / we + verb (base form)​

(We only use 'shall' with 'I' and 'we').

#### Example
